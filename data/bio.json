  "She is a gorgeous Latina, with the thick body to match. 38Ds with wide juicy hips and clean. Tongue ring and a few tattoos. He is a charming mix Latino. Clean body no piercings but has a tattoo. He is very well endowed and not afraid to ask for directions or orders. We are always open to request. We are both educated professionals. D&D FREE!",
  "We're a sexy AA couple with everything in the right places. We pride ourselves in our cleanliness and ability to relate to just about everyone.... we are a couples dream and A FREAKY COUPLES FANTASY. ..",
  "She is petite and cute, tries to stay in shape. She is bi-playful, just depends on the fun & attraction! Does not like anyone that is pushy, prefers things to click and flow naturally.",
  "Probably not the droid you're looking for. I'm uninhibited, sensual, cheerful, comfortable in my own body. Green eyes, curves, and a sense of humor. I keep active with yoga or lifting weights, walk my dogs almost as often as I should, and give a better than average massage. I have a terrible singing voice, love to dance, and am equally drawn to raucous parties and quiet nights. I live out in the county with my partner and more animals than comfortably fit on the bed at night.",
  "She likes to listen and laugh a lot. If you can make her laugh, chances are she will find you attractive. “Minutemen” are not what she’s looking for. She likes confident (not cocky), secure and sexually dominant men. She tends to be somewhat dominant herself and enjoys the power struggle. She likes being able to get you off without it wrapping things up for the night after 10 minutes. She is bi but is very picky. It doesn't hurt to try ;) She likes the take charge kind of guys, not to be confused with pushy guys that don't respect her limits or interests. Bad teeth are a big problem for her. He is all about \"her\" - both his darling wife, and the woman (women?!?!!?) he is having fun with. He is not shy and has been known to enjoy “putting on a show” for interested watchers (or whoever happens to be there). He has eyes that change color sometimes, is completely straight and very attentive. He's friendly and (possibly a bit much) talkative. When we're meeting people as friends, especially newbies, he makes you feel comfortable and relaxed. He's definitely an ice-breaker. He's a baseball player and is in good shape. We like going to clubs. We travel often for work and like to check out clubs in the places we go. Our home is in the Orlando area, but if you see us near you, we’d love to hear about what’s going on locally.",
  "Hard working professionals, discretion is a must, love the outdoors, spending time at events watching people enjoy life, very adventurous and hoping to find people that have the same outlook and places to hang out together"
