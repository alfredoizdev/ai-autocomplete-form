# Testing Autocomplete After Spell Check Fixes

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Basic Spell Check Correction
1. Type: "I am a sofware developer who"
2. Click on "sofware" when it shows as misspelled
3. Select "software" from suggestions
4. Continue typing and verify autocomplete triggers after 3 more words

### 2. Multiple Corrections
1. Type: "I work on web developement and enjoy programing"
2. Correct "developement" to "development"
3. Continue typing and check if autocomplete works
4. Correct "programing" to "programming"
5. Continue typing and verify autocomplete still works

### 3. Cursor Position Test
1. Type a sentence with a misspelling in the middle
2. Correct the misspelling
3. Verify cursor position is maintained
4. Continue typing from cursor position
5. Check if autocomplete triggers properly

## Expected Behavior
- After spell check correction, autocomplete should resume after typing 3 new words
- Cursor position should be maintained after corrections
- No duplicate triggers or stuck states
- Smooth transition between spell check and autocomplete features
